## Description
Just a basic password manager written in Go. This is not ready for use and still needs a lot of work. The purpose of creating this was mostly to learn Go syntax and not to create a fully fledged and secure password manager.

## To be done
- Replace the encryption key with secure and randomly selected keys
- Add input validation and error handling
- SQLite used for now but may change this to PostgreSQL
